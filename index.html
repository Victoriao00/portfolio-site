            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p> Iâ€™m currently a rising second-year MPH student at Emory University with a growing passion for computer science. My interest sparked through coursework that introduced me to data analysis languages like <strong>SAS</strong> and <strong>R</strong>, which inspired me to explore more creative, tech-based projects beyond academia. Born in Ethiopia, raised in Norway, and based in the U.S. since 2010, I bring a unique, cross-cultural perspective to every project. </p>

            <h2>Academic Projects </h2>  
            <p> With the use of ArcGIS, I created <a href="GIS-Spatial-Analysis-of-Census-Data.pptx.pptx" target="_blank">thematic maps </a> using spatial data, performed attribute table analysis, and joined datasets to visualize trends in burglary rates, age distribution, and agricultural density across U.S. counties. Applied selection queries, calculated normalized fields, and produced final map layouts with legends and statistical insights. </p>
            <p> This <a href="Quant-Final-Poster.pdf" target="_blank">SAS project</a>  examined substance use disparities among LGBTQ individuals using BRFSS data. The project highlighted how adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health intersect with sexual identity to influence substance use behavior.</p>
